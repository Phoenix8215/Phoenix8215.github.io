We introduce AccidentX, a large-scale multimodal dataset for traffic accident analysis and prevention in autonomous driving. It contains over 10,000 BEV videos from CARLA with rich annotations, offering seven times more frames than nuScenes. Leveraging VLMs and GPT-4o, AccidentX enables comprehensive scene understanding and establishes benchmarks for advanced MLLMs. The dataset will be fully open-sourced to support research in driving safety.
